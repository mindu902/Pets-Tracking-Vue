# Pets-Tracking-Vue
The website assists pet owners in managing their pet's medical documents and tracking health parameters. Users can also create events, tasks, and bookings and are notified when events/tasks/bookings are approaching.

Vuejs is used as the framework, Element-plus is used as the component library, and Firebase cloud storage is used to store pdf/img format files.

- Dashboard shows folders, events, tasks and bookings
